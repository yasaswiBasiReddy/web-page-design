<p>When you <b>spend a lot of time</b>, like I do, just <i>standing around and waiting</i>, or being moved from place to place, every minute gets  <em>consumed by something</em> someone else has set up for you. And it's not like <mark>I'm always in a beautiful place</mark> wearing something gorgeous.</p>
<p>
  <mark>I love Australia</mark>; it was a really, really nice experience for me. <b>It's such a beautiful place</b>. <i>The people are beautiful </i>- like, really beautiful - and they are beautiful in terms of their personalities. <em>It's a great place to be. It's like you are in a little bit of a dream world</em>.
